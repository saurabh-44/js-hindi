    /* 8------------------------------------------bind()------------------------------------------
    => bind() method is used to create a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value. 
    This is particularly useful when working with event handlers or when you want to ensure that the context (this) remains consistent, 
    even when passing methods around.
    => bind() ensures that the method's this context refers to the correct object 
    => It's commonly used in event handlers and when passing methods as callbacks, where the default behavior of this might change due to the calling context.*/
